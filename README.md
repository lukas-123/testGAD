# testGAD
Simple testing package for GAD at TUM

## To use:

Simply copy it in the src Folder of your Project. To see the new package in Eclipse, rightclick your project in the Project Manager and click on refresh(F5).

### Edit in Main the following things: 
* ~FOLDERNAME~    Replace it with the Foldername of the tests. The Folder should be placed directly in your project(not in src)
* ~PACKAGENAME~   Replace it with the Name of the package you would like to test


If you run Main it should test all Cases it finds in the folder until it hits a test with a wrong answer.
